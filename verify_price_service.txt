// Mock Supabase or ensure environment variables are set if running locally
// Since we are running in the browser/node environment of the user, we might need to handle imports carefully.
// Actually, running this as a standalone script might be hard due to module imports (ESM vs CJS) and environment variables.

// Instead, I will create a small temporary UI component or modifying an existing one to log the output to console, 
// OR I can use the `run_command` to run a node script IF the project is set up for it (e.g. type: module).

// Let's rely on the browser subagent to verify this invocation in the app context, 
// OR simpler: Add logging to `UnitConversionModal.jsx` and `purchasePriceService.js` and ask user to try, 
// BUT since I can't ask user to try seamlessly, I should try to reproduce if possible.

// Alternative: I can write a test file in `tests/` if they exist, or just a temporary execution script.
// given the 'package.json' is not visible, I'll assume standard vite/react setup.

// Let's try to list the files in the 'app-data' bucket first using a direct script if possible, 
// but `purchasePriceService` depends on `../supabase` which depends on `process.env`.
// So running a node script might fail if env vars are not set.

// I'll try to visually debug by adding console logs in the code and then opening the app in the browser tool.
